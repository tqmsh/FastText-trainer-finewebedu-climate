A royal visit was conducted as a part of server population stress test. A player character known as Rainz cast a spell called “fire field” on Lord British that, surprisingly, killed him. According to Starr Long, the whole thing was just a human error: Lord British’s character, like others, had been made invulnerable, but by design the invulnerability did not persist over several game sessions. Shortly before the incident, the server had crashed, and Richard Garriott had forgotten to set his invulnerability flag on when logging on again. Shortly afterwards, Rainz’s account was banned from the beta test for previously exploiting bugs rather than reporting them (infamously used by his character Aquaman to kill many player characters, a purported griefing incident). According to Origin, he was not banned for the assassination but rather for previous complaints against his account that were brought to light as a result of this attention. The massive amount of lag, caused by the stress test, was a factor in Lord British’s death, as well as the guards being deactivated in the area, which allowed Rainz to steal, avoiding immediate death. 99% of the players were at Lord British’s castle. Only the few at Lord Blackthorn’s castle were the lucky witnesses to this historic event. Those known to have been present besides Lords British and Blackthorn were their jesters Chuckles and Heckles and the following players; Rainz, Dr.Pepper, Mental, DemonSoth, Haaaaaach, Helios, Phobos, Gildoreal, Wind Lord and Kylan.\n3) The Epic Heist – EVE Online – November 2005″\nThis was published in September’s 2005 issue of PC Gamer UK. It is a detailed account of what has to be one of most beautifully executed in-game scams in a MMORPG ever pulled. It breaks all previous world records for ‘virtual crime’.\nThe game in question is Eve Online, where corporate espionage and political intrigue have become an integral part of the game.\nThe perpetrator of the heist was the Guiding Hand Social Club (GHSC) corporation (a corporation being similar to a clan in Eve); a freelance mercenary outfit that offers their services (which usually involves corp infiltration, theft and assassination) to the highest bidder. Over a year in planning, the GHSC infilitrated their target’s corp with their own members and gained their trust, as well as access to the corp hangers, with time. It all concluded in a perfectly timed climax, with a massive theft in multiple corp hangars synchronized with the in-game killing of the corporation’s CEO, the primary target of the contract.\nWhat’s most interesting and impressive about this operation is that it was entirely ‘legal’ and within the game’s own rules, and the mastermind and his agents pulled it off together flawlessly, all the while staying in character. The estimated real-life value of the items stolen is, according to PC Gamer, $16,500 US. The in-game value of course is much, much higher as the things stolen would take years and years to aquire.\n4) Plague Outbreak – World of Warcraft – September 2005\nThe Corrupted Blood plague incident was one of the first events to affect entire World of Warcraft servers. Patch 1.7 saw the opening of Zul’Gurub, the game’s first 20-player raid dungeon where players faced off against an ancient tribe of jungle trolls under the sway of the ancient Blood God, Hakkar the Soulflayer. Upon engaging Hakkar, players were stricken by a debuff (a spell that negatively affects a player) called “Corrupted Blood” which would periodically sap their life. The disease would also be passed on to other players who were simply standing in close proximity to an infected person. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul’Gurub instance but made its way into the outside world by way of hunter or warlock pets that contracted the disease.\nWithin hours Corrupted Blood had infected entire cities such as Ironforge and Orgrimmar because of their high player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds by the high-damage disease. Eventually Blizzard fixed the issue so that the plague could not exist outside of Zul’Gurub.\n5) Death of the Sleeper – EverQuest – November 15-17, 2003\nThe guild Blood of the Spider on The Rathe server was the first guild system-wide to kill Ventani (the fourth warder) on July 28, 2001, and therefore wake the sleeper. The event caused a stir on the server when Kerafyrm went into multiple zones, including Skyshrine, killing everyone and everything in his path.\nOn November 15, 2003, on the Rallos Zek PvP server, the three top guilds (Ascending Dawn, Wudan, and Magus Imperialis Magicus) assembled over 180 players with the intent to wake and kill The Sleeper. This was in response to an attempt to wake The Sleeper by an Iksar monk named Stynkfyst, who partnered with the largest random-pk guild of the time. Having been a former member of uber-guild Ascending Dawn, he had the knowledge the random pk guild needed to wake The Sleeper. The top guilds did not assemble their forces until word of Stynkfyst’s intentions had spread, and it became clear that he intended to wake The Sleeper, forever preventing future guilds from farming the old loot table. Until this point, waking The Sleeper had not been seriously considered by any guilds, as it was believed that waking The Sleeper would make the offending guild’s players kill-on-sight to the other guilds of the server. After 3 hours and 15 minutes, at 26% health, Kerafyrm disappeared (despawned). The players talked with the EverQuest Game Masters, and there was a general consensus that a bug had caused the problem, although some suggested (backed by statements from one GM) that higher-ups at SOE had purposely despawned Kerafyrm, because it was not intended to be part of the story.\nThe following day, the players logged in to find that Kerafyrm was back in his “sleeping” state, ready to be triggered again. There was also an apology on the official EverQuest forums from SOE, explaining that they had stopped the encounter because they feared the players were engaging the boss in an unintended manner. Although annoyed (the players pointed out that the reasons SOE gave could not have occurred, and felt lied to), they attempted to battle Kerafyrm once again.\nOn November 17, 2003, after a nearly 3-hour battle, Kerafyrm was defeated. He had between 100 million and 400 million hit points, likely around 250 million (most EverQuest bosses have 2 million at most), was immune to all spells except wizard’s manaburn spell and Shadow Knight’s Harm Touch, possessed two death touch abilities (abilities that automatically killed players), and attacked players for 6999 damage per swing. By using the cleric’s epic weapon and other resurrection spells, the players were able to bring their dead characters back into the battle faster than Kerafyrm could kill them all.", "text_hash": "77999d1c1a80bbda", "label": "NO", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "prompt_version": "v1", "timestamp": "2025-12-16T22:01:51.218015"}

In a normal house, this would be a virtual non-event. Someone would walk by, see them, pick them up, and put them away. Luckily for you, we live in a house where people don’t seem bothered by boxes of tissues in odd places. I’d be wiling to bet that I could glue an inverted box of tissues to the living room ceiling and not hear a word about it for months. Unless someone sneezed, in which case I’d be asked where the tissues were. In such a situation I might reply with a single finger pointed up, resulting in wonder and excitement from my children who would have completely missed the point of the exercise.\nThis time though, the tissues were left on the floor where we all stepped over them for days.

{"id": "<urn:uuid:8f4b98cc-b9b6-4f03-bdfe-20c3e3a71278>", "text": "Blogger: Steve Rowland, Public Affairs Manager\nSpring seemed a long way off last week as I took my lunchtime walk through the woods, the leaves on the trees were yet to unfurl, the ground was bare and covered in a mulch of last autumns dead leaves, and a light, cold wintry rain drizzled down.\nAnd yet I realised that my mind had picked up on the subtle changes in the quality of light and drawing out of the days. I became aware of a slight tightness in my ears, an unconscious straining and heightened alertness to the bird song around me. And I thought that after more Springs as a birder than I care to remember, my brain was quietly and unobtrusively saying to my ears to be alert for couple of unremarkable notes of bird song one up followed repetitively by another down, up and down in short bursts, from a bird that takes its name from these two notes of song, the chiff chaff. (photo below).\nNaming a bird after the sound it makes is known as onomatopoeia and two other species that occur in the UK the cuckoo and the kittiwake also take their names from their calls.\nI will acknowledge here that chiff chaffs are not blessed with the most captivating of names or musical of songs. But for me they compensate for that with the charisma that comes from being the first of our returning migrants to fill our bare Spring woods with their song, perhaps a month before the other returning warblers have got back from a winter spent south of the Sahara.\nChiff chaffs like many of our other warblers, might at a glance appear a little drab and indistinct. In particular at first you might easily confuse a chiff chaff with its close relative the willow warbler. (photo below).\nA rough guide to telling them apart is that a willow warblers legs are a light flesh colour whilst a chiff chaffs are black and a chiff chaffs has a more olive coloured plumage (being a birder you carry a veritable colour palette in your head to describe shades of green and brown feathers).\nBut the surest way to tell these cousins apart is to listen to them singing. Compared to the chiff chaffs repetitive two notes, willow warblers have a to my mind a much nicer song, a lovely tinkling sound that seems to gently descend a set of musical scales before being hauled by the bird back to the top only to descend down them once more.\nWillow warblers arrive from their wintering grounds in Africa a little later in the spring than chiff chaffs which tend to spend the winter in the Mediterranean. So my brain wasn't tipping my ears off to listen out for a willow warbler practicing its scales, but for that starting gun of the season, a simple two note Chiff then Chaff song that would light up the woods and put a smile on my face, a sign of the end of winter and the beginning of natures headlong rush into spring.\nI didn’t hear a chiff chaff last week but I’ll be out again for a lunchtime walk in the woods this week, listening carefully for those two notes. If you have some time to spare over the next week or so why don’t you go out and see if you can hear a chiff chaff and then tell us here.\nPhotos credit John Bridges (rspb-images.com)\nBlogger: Kate Blincoe, Communications Manager\nLook out of your window. The catkins are swaying in the spring breeze, the blue tit is hunting out caterpillars for its young family and an early bumblebee buzzes by. Nature is busy all around us.\nWhat if pound signs were flashing over all these beautiful, natural events? If you look on these living things as paid workers for us then the catkins tree is capturing carbon, the blue tit is performing pest control on your garden and the bumblebee is a professional pollinator. All these creatures are in fact performing tiny actions that in sum, add up to a healthy environment and hence healthy economy. In simple terms, if they didn’t do it for free, we’d have to pay to find a technical replacement.\nLet’s look at some of the massive ways in which we benefit financially from nature. Carefully managed wetlands reduce the risk of flooding to our homes and businesses. Salt marshes, such wonderful habitats, provide protection from sea level rise, acting like big sponges. Forests and peat bogs store carbon for us, helping in the battle against climate change.\nThe list doesn’t end there: It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on insect pollination, most of which is accomplished by bees pollinating crops. Of course, beautiful places with charismatic wildlife also equal booming tourism and lots of visitor spend – especially in our stunning region.\nWhat about you and me and a walk together in the bluebell woods? Does that have pound signs attached to it? Yes. It will reduce our stress levels, increase our heart rates and hence improve our health. It’s a proven fact that nature is good news for the NHS budgets. For children, time spent in nature can even improve their behaviour and performance at school.\nAs a bit of a nature loving ‘tree hugger’, a part of me screams at this reduction of wonder and marvel to pounds and pennies. Wildlife means so much more than that and has a basic, intrinsic right to exist. I believe that is the case, however, when so many political arguments are made in financial terms, it doesn’t do us any harm to be able to speak that language too.\nIn a troubled economy, the need for a new development or construction project is often justified by saying growth is critical for our financial future. However, if we trash our special habitats and lose incredible species then, even in crude monetary terms, we risk jeopardising so much more than we gain. We overlook the function that the environment plays in our economy at our peril.\nThe bottom line is this: We need nature more than it needs us.\nArticle in Eastern Daily Press on Saturday 10 March 2012.\nPhoto by Mark Sisson (rspb-images.com)\nBlogger: Jane Warren, RSPB in the East Green Team\nAs we edge along towards spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s worth sparing a thought for the climate. Today is the beginning of Climate Change Week (12-18 March), and there are easy ways for us all to get involved. Many of us are already doing our bit, but it’s always good to be reminded! So here are three things to do this week:\nGet cooking with Climate Week cuisine: Make food part of the solution to climate change by eating a low carbon meal during Climate Week. Just follow one or all of these three tips: eat less meat or dairy, eat local and seasonal ingredients, and eat leftovers.\nWalk, cycle or use public transport: Use Climate Week as an opportunity to use more sustainable ways to get to where you are going. Take the train or bus instead of driving. Take advantage of the spring weather (!) and walk or cycle, getting some additional exercise!\nSwap, recycle or upcycle old things: Eliminate waste by finding a second life for things that would otherwise be thrown away. Host an event to swap unwanted items, such as books, toys or clothes, with friends or colleagues. Recycle unusual things like batteries, or electrical goods such as old mobile phones.\nYou can even recycle through Ebay, by taking up the RSPB’s Ebay for charity challenge. Do you have something lurking in a loft, back room, garage or shed? Something that you know has some saleable value but you have never got around to selling? This could be your chance to do just that and step up for nature at the same time! Please do get in touch with suggestions of what you might have to sell, and we can check if it is worth us getting our fabulous Ebay volunteers to sell it on the auction site for us. Please do not send anything to us without checking first and please note that we can’t accept electrical goods! (It’s worth repeating that so that our collector Matt Howard isn’t locked in the cellar as punishment along with the potential deluge of books, CDs, DVDs, autographed Barry Manilow LPs etc.) Matt is looking forward to hearing from you at email@example.com Tel: 01603 697515.\nOur thanks to Climate Week for ideas and tips. Check out their website at www.climateweek.com and get inspired to create a sustainable future!\nBlogger: Gena Correale-Wardle, Community Fundraising Officer\nDo you remember in January when I blogged about the great partnership the RSPB had with Dozen Artisan Bakery and Pulse Cafe Bar, two great independent eateries in Norwich? I bet you’ve been waiting with baited breath to see how we got on....\nWell, today I went to see the lovely manager of Pulse, Helen, as she presented us with a great big cheque (literally – see the photo!) for £86.50. That equates to 173 starters, mains and desserts eaten in aid of the RSPB. Dozen Artisan Bakery sold their field loaves for nature too – another £91 and 91 satisfied tummies and smiles on faces! Wouldn’t it be nice if all fundraising could be that easy?!\nThe lovely people at both outlets also hosted pin badge boxes and gave out lots of leaflets to promote Big Garden Birdwatch, raising awareness of the project as well as raising even more money (over £40) through pin badge donations. A win-win all round!\nWe are really glad to work with such great local, independent businesses in the area and hope we can do more with them in future. We are always looking for ways to get businesses involved throughout the whole of the Eastern England region so if you have any links or want to promote your business and raise money for nature in the process, do get in touch!\nThe money raised will help the RSPB save and protect wildlife supporting schools and families through field teaching programmes and schools visits as well as directly managing habitats for wildlife at our amazing nature reserves.\nThank you to all of you who ate great food and saved nature at the same time. Here’s to more fab little initiatives like this in the future!

The island was a perfect tonic as there were no modern day distractions that seem to fill our free time usually. This meant that we had an excuse of not doing very much at all – just what I needed after the crazy hustle bustle of the RSPB Eastern Region office in Norwich.\nEach day we would spend many hours in wellies walking the island. In the interior we spotted dancing flocks of skylarks, eyeing foxes in the distance and then the adventurers inside us would walk alongside the beaches and salt marshes to circumnavigate our little piece of Essex. If we were lucky enough to get the tides right we would see vast numbers of birds coming into feed or queuing up ready for the seafood frenzy. The rest of my family were happy to spot a “funny looking goose” or distinctive oyster catcher with their carrot beaks. I on the other hand, trained zoologist and bitten by the RSPB bug, realised that I wasn’t just seeing a few species of animals out there on the mud flats but dozens – all ever so slightly different. However, this is my question to you – how on earth are you supposed to tell the difference? I am now going to give it a go. The keen ones amongst you, feel free to correct me, I won’t take it personally ;)\nDunlin: Little fella, grey wings, white belly, slightly curved beak\nTurnstone: Little, black wings, white belly, red legs\nCommon sandpiper: brown body, straight beak, black eye stripe\nCurlew sandpiper: if you squidged the two sandpipers together\nGreen sandpiper: dark, white bellied sandpiper that is not green\nGrey plover: a more speckly version of a turnstone\nCurlew: This one I get, bendy beak and big as a chicken!\nRedshank: Medium sized, red legs and red beak near face\nSpotted redshank: red legs, black top beak, red lower beak\nSo, can you see why I was confused. It doesn't help that when I was reading the information on my RSPB i-phone app it told me that these are the winter plumages of these birds - so as new species come in for the summer I will have to learn this all over again. I did however figure out that the bird call I has associated with the wilds of southern Ireland ( a previous family holiday) was not the charismatic oyster catcher but the close neighbours the curlew.\nI guess the beauty of this whole thing is now, once I get my eye in, I realise how many different species find the eerie and beautiful Essex coast a perfect tonic, just what they need.", "text_hash": "269e79ccb29a4cf3", "label": "NO", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "prompt_version": "v1", "timestamp": "2025-12-16T22:01:55.870234"}

Republican candidate for president Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin stepped off their brightly-lit Straight Talk Air chartered jet last night, into a cool mist visible in the blazing headlights of the happy caravan that waited to carry them straight toward their date with destiny - Election Day.\nIt won't be cool and misty around Gov. Palin for long, however.\nThe campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has already sc`ored her for attracting some $300 in earmarks for every man, woman and child in Alaska - compared to the national average of $30 per person in other states.\nShe quickly struck back on Saturday, though, saying Sen. Obama had won more than abillion dollars in earmarks for hi Illinois constituency. \"Just wait till John McCain puts a stop to that,\" she said. McCain pleaded in his acceptance speech last Thursday night to end the coveted earmarks that cost American taxpayers billions of dollars each year but individually benefit just a few in their home states.\nThe long-distance exchange as she related it was nonetheless enough to spark wild cheers and applause from an appreciative audience. In the words of one campaign worker, she \"has ignited this campaign like a California wildfire.\"\nThe nominees brought their \"Road to Victory Rally\" to this Rebublican bastion in the shadow of the mighty Pikes Peak Friday afternoon, and the 10,000 tickets distributed didn't come close to meeting the demand.\nThe 85,000 voices cheering for the Democrats' presidential pick, Sen. Barack Obama, 60 miles north in Denver, had barely died away before the reverberations of McCain's stunning vice-presidential selection reached the Rocky Mountains.\nIn this sprawling city at the foot of the Rockies that is home to the U.S. Air Force Academy and widely known for its conservative voters, Palin took the occasion to blast Sen. Joe Biden, who has said she will be a \"formidable\" opponent in upcoming vice-presidential debates despite little experience to compare to Biden's 30 years in Congress, where he chairs the Senate Foreign Relations committee.\nThe rally was a remarkable contrast to one a near here a month ago, when McCain stood before just 300 workers at a Colorado company to ask for their votes. After his startling choice of a running mate seized the media spotlight, this afternoon to an overflow crowd of 13,000, and many more were turned away for lack of space.\nAs thousands waved American flags inside a cavernous hangar, Palin called Sen. Biden \"a fine man\" but one flawed by his Establishment ties, according to Newsday.\n\"Senator Biden can claim many chairmanships across many, many years in Washington. He certainly has many friends in Washington's establishment,\" Palin said.\n\"But most of his admirers,\" she said, \"would not call him an agent of change.\" But, she said, \"Senator McCain has called us a ticket of mavericks.\"\nThis was the third stop together in the 72 hours since McCain accepted hia party's highest accolade in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn., the site of the Republican National Convention, after brief stops in Wisconsin and Chicago.\nBarely pausing at the top of the stairway of the campaign plane \"Straight Talk Express,\" McCain, accompanied by his wife Cindy, and Alaska's Gov. Palin, were loaded into a waiting black SUV and their accompanying entourage quickly sped off.\nFlanked by U.S. Secret Service vehicles, local police cruisers and motorcycles, the motorcade's flashing lights flared briefly, not even causing a ripple on the Ronald Reagan Highway, the name given to Interstate 25 in staunchly Republican El Paso County - home to the evangelical Christian congregation Focus on the Family's and former GOP presidential candidate Rep. Tom Tancredo.\nIt's probably not coincidence that the first major stop on the campaign trail was here, the home of McCain's most vocal detractors in the GOP ranks. Rev. James Dobson, who heads Focus on the Family has stated previously he would not support the Arizona senator's presidential bid, but that stance softened sowmewhat after the convention. The strong conservative base is sure to jump on the Palin bandwagon however, given her opposition to abortion and contraceptives in high schools.\nThe campaign did not respond to The American Reporter's query on the timing or location of the first stop on the Road to Victory tour, but it is sure to benefit from media coverage of scores of adoring Palin fans, who themselves are reminiscent of the kind of attention Obama first generated here in his primary battle.\nThe allure of the first women Republican vice-presidential candidate seems to match the response to the country's first African-American nominee for President.\nJoe Shea contributed to this story from Florida.", "text_hash": "8ec5cc8793a1836f", "label": "NO", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "prompt_version": "v1", "timestamp": "2025-12-16T22:01:58.652478"}
{"id": "<urn:uuid:b14cf72c-25cd-4f12-b45a-f2431b43201b>", "text": "What can you do to create a healthier personal environment?\nAssess your nest.\nWorking with a home inspector, public health professional, contractor, or other construction expert as a guide, ask yourself some questions to evaluate your current house or apartment's environmental health:\n- Are you free of the \"big three?\" Radon, mold, and lead are all common home toxins. Radon testing is widely available, and best practices exist in new construction to minimize radon entry into the property. Check for moisture problems that act as hotbeds for mold growth, and look into mold testing if necessary. Finally, lead is present in many older homes' paint and pipes. Call your local public health department for information on testing for and eliminating lead in your home.\n- How well-ventilated is your home? While solid construction decreases your home's energy loss, a home that is too airtight can seal in indoor air pollutants. Proper ventilation also helps control moisture and reduce risk of mold and other environmental health concerns. Simple fixes to increase ventilation include installing ceiling fans and operable skylights and windows.\n- Does your landscaping contribute to your environmental health? Large lawns traditionally require greater pesticide use, and increase air and noise pollution generated from mowing. Consider planting perennial groundcovers, native foliage, or other low-maintenance landscaping. Even better, landscape with edible plants and devote a portion of your yard to organic vegetable gardening.\nBefore you rent or begin new construction, consider these additional questions:\n- Will your new space support recycling/reuse with storage space for cans, bottles, paper, and other items?\n- What is your potential home's proximity to major noisemakers like airports, railroad tracks, or highways?\n- What will keep you warm? Although most mainstream commercial insulations are considered safe, check out some healthy alternative insulation, including those made with recycled denim and other cloth, wool, icynene and nanogel.\n- How big is your planned home? Small is good. A well-planned home with less square footage uses fewer building and maintenance resources.\nClear the air.\nConsider these steps toward improving indoor air quality:\n- In your home, radon and mold tend to be the most serious barriers to indoor air quality. Relatively inexpensive tests exist to assess your home's mold and radon levels.\n- The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) offers guidelines about common workplace air quality complaints, which usually focus on temperature, humidity, lack of outside air ventilation or smoking. Find out more .\n- For employees in farming and industrial fields, on-the-job outdoor air quality is also a concern. Each state has a department of environmental health within its main health department that can advise workers and employers on outdoor air quality regulations. To find your state's health department, visit the Centers for Disease Control site.\n- If you smoke, stop. If you live with someone who smokes, insist on a strict outdoor smoking policy. Approximately 3,000 American adults die of lung cancer each year due to secondhand smoke exposure. In young children, secondhand smoke increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and asthma.\nKnow your H20.\nIncrease your water quality with these tips:\n- The longer water has been sitting in pipes, the more lead it may contain. Run or \"flush\" your tap for up to two minutes, depending upon how long it's been between uses.\n- Since hot water is more likely to contain lead, only drink, cook and make baby formula with cold water.\n- The only way to be totally certain about your home's water quality is to have it tested. This is especially important for people in high-rise buildings, where \"flushing\" the pipes may not be as effective. Your local water supplier, health department or university can offer information about credible testing resources.\n- Water filters have been shown to increase purity. Filters can range from simple pitcher-based systems to more elaborate reverse-osmosis home units.\n- Remember that bottled water is not necessarily of higher quality than regular tap water. And according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, 60 million plastic bottles a day are manufactured, transported and then disposed of in U.S. landfills, compromising your community's environmental health.\nGreen your cleaning.\nAre your cleaning products messing up your health? While we're far from knowing the health impact of all chemicals used in cleaning agents, you can easily (and very inexpensively) create your own house-healthy cleaners. Some tips:\n- Mix either vinegar or baking soda with warm water in a spray bottle, and you've got an effective, all-purpose cleansing agent.\n- Bypass commercial air deodorizers, many of which contain formaldehyde. Instead, add cinnamon, essential oils, cloves, or any herbs you like to a pan of boiling water, and let the sweet steam deodorize.\n- On laundry day, reach for Borax (sodium borate). This natural mineral acts as a stain-remover, bleach alternative and detergent booster. Baking soda can remove stains and deodorizes, and cornstarch absorbs greasy stains and starches your clothing. Lemon juice can also double for bleach.\n- Salt (sodium chloride) is a mild abrasive for cleaning bathrooms and kitchens.\n- Consider hiring a \"green\" cleaning service, or ask your traditional housekeeper to use the methods and products you find healthiest.\nIncrease your chemical awareness.\nWhile it's impractical to try to have no contact with chemicals, you can reduce your chemical exposure in relatively simple ways:\n- Some beauty products contain chemicals that are anything but pretty. For example, nail polish, body lotions, and perfumes often contain phthalates, a controversial substance linked to birth defects in animals and possibly humans. Shampoos that attack dandruff might also play havoc on your health; the active ingredient selenium sulfide is a neurotoxin and possible carcinogen. Hair dyes often have coal tar, another chemical linked to cancer. So read labels, and choose a product that will be as lovely for your health as it is for your appearance.\n- Don't create toxic trash. If you're tossing old medications, resist flushing them down the toilet, where they can invade water supplies. Also consider calling your local recycler, many of which accept old cleaning products, paint, oil and other chemicals that create even more treacherous landfills.\n- Be sure to air out your garments after a trip to the drycleaners. Dry cleaning employs a chemical called perchloroethylene, which is actually toxic to humans. Some environmentally conscious cleaners use methods that do not contain \"perc;\" seek them out. Better yet, when possible choose clothing that only requires a trip to your laundry room, not a professional cleaner.\n- Be mindful of plastic use. Some plastics contain bisphenol A (BPA), an estrogen-like chemical potentially linked to cancer. Experts also advise against microwaving food in plastic containers; although research is inconclusive, the heating process is thought to release chemicals from the plastic into your food. Reusing plastic bottles is another source of controversy. Some experts think reuse is safe if you carefully wash and dry the bottles between each use, while others feel that wear and tear on the plastic causes toxic chemical leakage. An always-safe alternative is glass. Finally, you can reduce the amount of plastic produced by recycling. Look at the bottom of your plastic container for a number from 1-7. Items labeled 1 or 2 (usually soft drink, jjuice, water, milk, and detergent containers) are eligible for curbside recycling. Numbers higher than 2 are either unrecyclable or require special drop-off at a recycling center.\nReduce the roar.\nDecrease sound pollution at home and work with these simple suggestions:\n- Employ low-tech solutions like earplugs and heavy curtains to block street noise.\n- White noise machines and noise-cancelling headphones also create quiet.\n- Double-paned windows reduce outdoor noise, including jet traffic.\n- Before you begin new construction projects, communicate with your architect and/or contractor about noise reduction options. Some building materials and methods offer greater sound absorption or masking than others.\n- When you are engaged in construction projects, or if you work in construction or another noisy trade, always wear hearing protection on the job.\n- Be mindful about your personal noise production. For example, are you really watching your television, or is it simply on as \"background noise?\" Could you use a push mower instead of a power model, a shovel rather than a snow blower? Could you bike instead of drive? Select \"vibrate\" rather than the latest ringtone? Even small actions increase the peace.\nRaise your EMF awareness.\nIt is important to note that research on EMF exposure is ongoing. But these easy actions just might improve your wellbeing:\n- When possible, use a land line rather than your cell phone.\n- Use a hands free device or speaker phone function if using a cell phone.\n- Do not stand directly in front of your microwave oven while it's in use, or simply use your conventional oven.\n- Limit your computer time.\n- Use manual versions of personal care tools: an old-fashioned toothbrush rather than an electric model, or a razor instead of an electric shaver.\n- Don't sleep under an electric blanket.\n- Sit several feet from your television screen.\nEnjoy local and organic foods.\nThe foods you choose not only impact your health from a nutritional standpoint, but from an environmental angle as well. Think about these fast facts:\n- Eating locally grown produce means less transportation is required to get that apple from the tree to your table. This translates to reduced air and noise pollution in your community.\n- Organic farming doesn't employ the pesticides often used in non-organic methods. That means that eating organic produce may reduce your ingestion of chemicals, and that pesticides will not leach into local water supplies. Joining a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) food plan might \"cleanse\" your diet and help your water supply.\n- Research indicates that raising livestock increases greenhouse gas emissions, pollutes water supplies, and contributes to land degradation and deforestation.
